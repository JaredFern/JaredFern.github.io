My goal is to build practical and robust systems capable of understanding, reasoning, and interacting with the real world via natural language.\nPreviously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Northwestern University where I worked with Doug Downey and Thrasos Pappas. I\u0026rsquo;ve also spent time as a Software Engineer at Google.\nOutside of research, I enjoy spending time outdoors hiking, listening to a wide variety of music, trying new restaurants and playing games.\nEmail: jaredfern [at] cmu.edu\nNews: $\\qquad$ [Aug. 2020] $\\quad$ Starting as a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University! $\\qquad$ [Nov. 2019] $\\quad$ Starting fulltime as a Software Engineer at Google!\n","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://jaredfern.com/author/jared-fernandez/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/jared-fernandez/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a first-year doctoral student in the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University where I am advised by Yonatan Bisk and Emma Strubell.\nMy research interests are primarily in machine learning and natural language processing.","tags":null,"title":"Jared Fernandez","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Yiben Yang","Chaitanya Malaviya","Jared Fernandez","Swabha Swayamdipta","Ronan Le Bras","Ji-Ping Wang","Chandra Bhagavatula","Yejin Choi","Doug Downey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"2a0a277561a034009837d0ce1e602cdb","permalink":"https://jaredfern.com/publication/gdaug/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gdaug/","section":"publication","summary":"Findings of EMNLP, 2020.","tags":["data augmentation","commonsense","question answering"],"title":"Generative Data Augmentation for Commonsense Reasoning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Chen","Mike D'arcy","Alisa Liu","Jared Fernandez","Doug Downey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"b9966e05ba0d9a68862f41435e4eef65","permalink":"https://jaredfern.com/publication/codah/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/codah/","section":"publication","summary":"Workshop on Evaluating Vector Space Representations for NLP (RepEval), 2019.","tags":["common sense","dataset","question-answering"],"title":"CODAH: An Adversarially Authored Question-Answer Dataset for Common Sense","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jared Fernandez","Doug Downey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"451c5aa4af41e87d0cf02d2459917729","permalink":"https://jaredfern.com/publication/rnn-is/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rnn-is/","section":"publication","summary":"ACL Student Research Workshop (ACL-SRW), 2018.","tags":["efficiency","rnnlm","language modeling"],"title":"Sampling Informative Training Data for RNN Language Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jared Fernandez","Zhaocheng Yu","Doug Downey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"2ae46e9c03567e136c54342bb01ca548","permalink":"https://jaredfern.com/publication/vecshare/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vecshare/","section":"publication","summary":"Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2017.","tags":["embedddings"],"title":"VecShare: A Framework for Sharing Word Representation Vectors","type":"publication"}]
