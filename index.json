It\u0026rsquo;s time to apply \u0026ndash; and written statements make up a large component of the application process for both graduate programs and research fellowships.\n  Statement of Purpose  NSF Research Statement  NSF Personal Statement  Ewwww, enunciating a longterm research direction can be quite difficult, while also being knee deep in experimental details of your current projects. While writing my own statements, I found it difficult to step back from my day-to-day work to create a more cohesive research plan.\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you\u0026rsquo;ve done cool work! Now you get to talk about why it was so awesome! Constructing a narrative about what your interests are their formation is a much more interesting read than a verbose version of your CV.\nHere were a few questions that I found helpful while writing my own statements:\n What were the big picture problems I was trying to solve \u0026ndash; and how did I address them? What did I learn about the research process? How did affect my current view of the field? Did it cause my interests to change? How do these experiences prepare me to do good research \u0026amp; explore my interests in the future?  Hopefully my ramblings were a bit useful, but if not, that\u0026rsquo;s cool \u0026ndash; there are a ton of other super awesome resources floating around the internet. In particular, these were pretty helpful for me:\n  Student Perspectives on Applying to NLP PhD Program  Kalpesh Krishna\u0026rsquo;s Grad School Resources  Lastly, many CS departments have started offering feedback on statements. I encourage people (especially those of underrepresented background) to take advantage of the opportunity.\n","date":1616630400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616630400,"objectID":"54475a22fda3b049aaf21d5b76a35df6","permalink":"https://jaredfern.com/post/applications/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/applications/","section":"post","summary":"Thoughts on breaking into research and industry.","tags":null,"title":"Applying to PhD Programs: Writing a SoP","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yiben Yang","Chaitanya Malaviya","Jared Fernandez","Swabha Swayamdipta","Ronan Le Bras","Ji-Ping Wang","Chandra Bhagavatula","Yejin Choi","Doug Downey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"2a0a277561a034009837d0ce1e602cdb","permalink":"https://jaredfern.com/publication/gdaug/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gdaug/","section":"publication","summary":"Findings of EMNLP, 2020.","tags":["data augmentation","commonsense","question answering"],"title":"Generative Data Augmentation for Commonsense Reasoning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Chen","Mike D'arcy","Alisa Liu","Jared Fernandez","Doug Downey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"b9966e05ba0d9a68862f41435e4eef65","permalink":"https://jaredfern.com/publication/codah/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/codah/","section":"publication","summary":"Workshop on Evaluating Vector Space Representations for NLP (RepEval), 2019.","tags":["common sense","dataset","question-answering"],"title":"CODAH: An Adversarially Authored Question-Answer Dataset for Common Sense","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jared Fernandez","Doug Downey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"451c5aa4af41e87d0cf02d2459917729","permalink":"https://jaredfern.com/publication/rnn-is/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rnn-is/","section":"publication","summary":"ACL Student Research Workshop (ACL-SRW), 2018.","tags":["efficiency","rnnlm","language modeling"],"title":"Sampling Informative Training Data for RNN Language Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jared Fernandez","Zhaocheng Yu","Doug Downey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"2ae46e9c03567e136c54342bb01ca548","permalink":"https://jaredfern.com/publication/vecshare/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vecshare/","section":"publication","summary":"Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2017.","tags":["embedddings"],"title":"VecShare: A Framework for Sharing Word Representation Vectors","type":"publication"}]
