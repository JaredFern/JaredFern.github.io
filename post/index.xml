      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;applying-to-grad-school&#34;&gt;Applying to Grad School&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re here, you are probably thinking about applying to graduate school and possibly have some ideas about why you enjoy research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ **That&#39;s awesome! Congratulations!** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now what? It&amp;rsquo;s time to apply &amp;ndash; and written statements make up a large component of the application process for both graduate programs and research fellowships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jaredfern.com/files/sop_cmu.pdf&#34;&gt;Statement of Purpose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jaredfern.com/files/GRFP_ResearchStatement.pdf&#34;&gt;NSF Research Statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jaredfern.com/files/GRFP_PersonalStatement.pdf&#34;&gt;NSF Personal Statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ewwww, enunciating a longterm research direction can be quite difficult, while also being knee deep in experimental details of your current projects. While writing my own statements, I found it difficult to step back from my day-to-day work to create a more cohesive research plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you&amp;rsquo;ve done cool work! Now you get to talk about why it was so awesome!&lt;/strong&gt;
Constructing a narrative about what your interests are their formation is a much more interesting read than a verbose version of your CV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here were a few questions that I found helpful while writing my own statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What were the big picture problems I was trying to solve &amp;ndash; and how did I address them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did I learn about the research process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did affect my current view of the field? Did it cause my interests to change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do these experiences prepare me to do good research &amp;amp; explore my interests in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- Lastly, there is a healthy dose of luck involved with admissions which makes the whole process a bit of a crapshoot. Rejection sucks but don&#39;t give up and try not to take things personally.

I was rejected from all of the schools I applied to the first cycle I applied but was eventually able find my way into an awesome PhD program.

But you know what? Don&#39;t forget, you&#39;re excited about research -- and that&#39;s still awesome! --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Opportunities: Independent Study, Thesis Projects, REUs
* Contacting Faculty: Courses, Office Hours, Academic Advisors/senior students, Emailing
* Learning the skillset, Familiarizing with the Literature --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully my ramblings were a bit useful, but if not, that&amp;rsquo;s cool &amp;ndash; there are a ton of other super awesome resources floating around the internet. In particular, these were pretty helpful for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, many CS departments have started offering feedback on statements. I encourage people (especially those of underrepresented background) to take advantage of the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
